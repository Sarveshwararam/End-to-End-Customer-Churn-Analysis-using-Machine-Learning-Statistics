# End-to-End Customer Churn Analysis using Machine Learning & Statistics

This project presents a complete data science workflow to analyze and predict
customer churn in a telecom dataset using statistical methods and machine
learning models. The goal is not only prediction accuracy, but also
interpretability and business-driven insights.

#Dataset
Telecom customer-level data containing demographic details, service usage,
billing information, and churn indicators.

#Objectives
- Understand key factors driving customer churn
- Apply statistical analysis before modeling
- Build and compare multiple ML models
- Segment customers using unsupervised learning
- Derive actionable business insights

#Techniques & Concepts Used

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Churn distribution analysis
- Demographic and service-based churn patterns

#Statistical Analysis
- Summary statistics by churn class
- Distribution and skewness analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Outlier detection using IQR
- Hypothesis-driven reasoning

#Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression (baseline classification)
- Support Vector Machine (margin-based classifier)
- K-Means Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Linear Regression (interpretability & trend analysis)

#Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering and encoding
3. Feature scaling and normalization
4. Train-test split with stratification
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Model comparison and interpretation

#Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC Curve and AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- R² and RMSE (for regression)

 #Key Insights
- Customers with short tenure are more likely to churn
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate
- Higher monthly charges increase churn risk
- Tech support and long-term contracts reduce churn
- Distinct customer segments show different churn behaviors
  
#Business Value
- Helps identify high-risk customers early
- Supports targeted retention strategies
- Enables customer segmentation for personalized offers
- Improves understanding of pricing and usage behavior

#Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

#Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- SHAP for model explainability
- Cost-sensitive learning for churn prediction

#Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end application of statistics and machine
learning to a real-world business problem, focusing on both predictive
performance and interpretability. It reflects industry-ready data science
practices and decision-oriented modeling.
